# MNIST Neural Network from Scratch

A fully custom-built neural network in **pure Python + NumPy** trained to recognize handwritten digits from the **MNIST dataset** â€” without using any deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

> "Don't just *use* machine learning. Understand how it *thinks*."

## Whatâ€™s Inside?

- âœ… Feedforward neural network (1 hidden layer)
- âœ… Custom backpropagation and gradient descent
- âœ… Trained on 60,000 images of handwritten digits
- âœ… Built 100% from scratch â€” no high-level libraries
- âœ… Educational, lightweight, and fully hackable
